3. Divergences
   - Fisher metric
   - Divergence from a manifold connection
   - Bregman divergence
   - Generalized Pythagoras theorem
4. Projections
   - Projection definition
   - e-projection and m-projection
   - MLE and m-projection
   - Maximum entropy principle
5. Applications
   - Overcomplete analysis
   - Natural Gradient Descent (NGD)
